# PHP version
The book is written for *JAVA* application.
Since I am learning design's patterns I decided to "translate" it to **PHP**

## Head First Design Patterns

### TODO:
- [ ] Adapter
- [ ] Collections
- [ ] Command
- [ ] Composite
- [ ] Decorator
- [ ] Factory
- [ ] Iterator
- [ ] Observer
- [ ] Singleton
- [ ] Singleton
- [ ] State
- [x] Strategy

## Strategy Pattern
**Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.**

### Design Principle #1
Identify the aspect's of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

### Design Principle #2
Program to an interface, not an implementation.

### Design Principle #3
Favor composition over inheritance


## Observer Pattern
**Defines a one-to-many dependency between so that when one objects changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.**
