# PHP version
The book is written for *JAVA* application.
Since I am learning design's patterns I decided to "translate" it to **PHP**

## Head First Design Patterns


## Strategy Pattern
**Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.**

### Design Principle #1
Identify the aspect's of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

### Design Principle #2
Program to an interface, not an implementation.

### Design Principle #3
Favor composition over inheritance
